## Welcome to Low Code February!

February is traditionally a month where we celebrate family, friends and loved ones - from Valentine's Day to Lunar New Year! We hope you also make this the month you fall in love with a new technology space - _low-code app development_ - and join us for a month of learning, making, and sharing!

We are excited to announce the **launch of #LowCodeFebruary**, a month-long developer journey that will take you from app development tips, to fusion teams insights, and hands-on tutorials to skill you up on Power Platform, Microsoft Azure, and popular developer tools to enhance your productivity.


## What will we cover?

Let's talk about what you will learn in our developer journey this month. We have multiple initiatives in mind that can help you _learn_, _skill up_, _engage with experts_, _contribute to community_ and _watch videos_ at your own pace.
